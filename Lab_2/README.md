# Student Database Management System

## Overview

This project implements a **Student Database Management System** in C. It reads student and course data from an input file, processes it using a linked list, and allows you to:

- Parse student and course records from a file.
- Display all students and their enrolled courses in a **readable hierarchical format**.
- Write the student database to an output file.
- Manage memory efficiently by freeing all allocated structures.

The system is modular, separating responsibilities across multiple files for maintainability.

## Project Structure

```bash

.
├── course.c          # Course-related functions
├── course.h          # Course structure definitions
├── student.c         # Student-related functions
├── student.h         # Student structure definitions
├── parser.c          # File parsing functions
├── parser.h          # Parser definitions
├── main.c            # Entry point of the program
├── Makefile          # Build instructions
├── record.csv        # Sample input file
├── output.csv        # Output file generated by the program

```

- **Source Files (`.c`)**: Implement functions for students, courses, and parsing.
- **Header Files (`.h`)**: Define structures and function prototypes.
- **Makefile**: Compiles the project into `student_db`.

---

## Compilation

Open a terminal in the project directory and run:

```bash
make
```

This will:

- Compile `.c` files into object files inside `obj/`.
- Link the object files into the executable `student_db`.

To clean up build artifacts:

```bash
make clean
```

---

## Usage

Run the program with an input file and an output file:

```bash
./student_db record.csv output.csv
```

- `record.csv` – Input file with student and course records.
- `output.csv` – Output file where the processed data is saved.

The program will:

1. Parse the input file.
2. Build an in-memory database using linked lists.
3. Print all students and their courses in a **hierarchical readable format**.
4. Save the same format to the output file.
5. Free all allocated memory.

---

## Output Format

Each student and their courses are displayed like this:

```bash
Roll No: 2, Name: aa, CGPA: 8.00, No of Subjects: 4
   Course: 520, Marks: 78.00
   Course: 470, Marks: 49.00
   Course: 620, Marks: 76.00
   Course: 450, Marks: 58.00

Roll No: 3, Name: ab, CGPA: 6.00, No of Subjects: 3
   Course: 620, Marks: 60.00
   Course: 450, Marks: 50.00
   Course: 560, Marks: 45.00

Roll No: 4, Name: ac, CGPA: 5.00, No of Subjects: 2
   Course: 450, Marks: 42.00
   Course: 560, Marks: 39.00
```

- Each student is displayed with **Roll No, Name, CGPA, and number of courses**.
- Each course is indented with **Course ID and Marks**.

---

## Dependencies

- GCC Compiler
- Linux/macOS or any system with GCC installed.

---

## Notes

- Ensure the input file exists before running.
- Provide both input and output file arguments; otherwise, the program will show usage instructions.
